Conservative Christians have been known to ridicule some of their more liberal counterparts by suggesting that they place too much emphasis on “Love”. However, I suggest that such ridicule is unwarranted. The KJV word for “Love” is “Charity”. Charity is a sacrificial love which is why the modern-day meaning of “charity” is equated with “giving”. Accordingly, when you see “charity” in the passage below, it should be understood to mean “sacrificial love”:">

&ndash; <strong>Proverbs 18:24a</strong></p>
<p>Conservative Christians have been known to ridicule some of their more liberal counterparts by suggesting that they place too much emphasis on “Love”. However, I suggest that such ridicule is unwarranted. The KJV word for “Love” is “Charity”. Charity is a sacrificial love which is why the modern-day meaning of “charity” is equated with “giving”. Accordingly, when you see “charity” in the passage below, it should be understood to mean “sacrificial love”:</p>
<p><strong>Charity</strong> suffers long, <em>and</em> is kind; <strong>charity</strong> envies not; <strong>charity</strong> vaunts not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil; Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. <strong>Charity</strong> never fails &hellip;
&ndash; <strong>1 Corinthians 13:4-8a</strong></p>
<p>And now abides faith, hope, <strong>charity,</strong> these three;
but the greatest of these <em>is</em> <strong>charity</strong>**.
&ndash; 1 Corinthians 13:13**</p>
<p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not <strong>charity,</strong> I am become <em>as</em> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
&ndash; <strong>1 Corinthians 13:1</strong></p>
<p>This is of paramount importance: If we were required to listen to a really bad band, the most irritating sound might emanate from the drummer. We should take a cue here from “the liberals” and realize that without love, we sound as a really bad drummer striking his cymbal repeatedly without rhythm.</p>
<p>In short, charity sings a chorus that is far more lovely than unsung preaching.
**
**Recall in <strong>John 3:16</strong>: God so loved the world “that he gave” &hellip;</p>
<p>Christians, we have a friend in Jesus! Let’s be likewise minded as he is by demonstrating charity in our earthly friendships.</p>
<p>there is a friend <em>that</em> sticks closer than a brother.
&ndash; <strong>Proverbs 18:24b</strong></p>
