Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why has thou made me thus? Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?” &ndash; Romans Chapter 9</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of the clear warning that mankind lacks accurate spiritual vision, we still judge situations, even though only God Himself has true clarity of vision.</p>
<p>For instance, what man or woman is qualified to determine those whom God favors? Who am I to judge if anyone is being blessed by God? Because He says, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 55:8)</p>
<p>Consider that Mary saw her son crucified before her very eyes: ”Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother&rsquo;s sister …” (John 19:25)</p>
<p>If I had been at the foot of the cross, I would not consider Mary to be one of God’s favorites &hellip; yet she was, as we read in Luke 1:28, ”And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.”</p>
<p>We all know the story of Job. Did you know that God described him this way: “there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil”?</p>
<p>The bible says, “the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.” (1 Sam 16)</p>
<p>We should all realize that when troubles come, God may be attempting to purify our hearts. Or perhaps, he is endorsing the life of someone that He knows can already handle &ldquo;tough luck&rdquo;. In other words, when bad things happen to us, it does NOT automatically mean that God is lifting His hand of blessing from off of our lives.</p>
<p>If you are currently facing adversity, I hope that you are encouraged by these words.</p>
